# Tips for Newcomers to Penn and Philadelphia

## Penn payroll system:

Penn offers [two options](http://www.finance.upenn.edu/comptroller/payroll/receiving_your_pay.shtml) for getting paid:

- Direct deposit
- ADP Aline Card

Most lab members use direct deposit to their US bank account.
You can [configure direct deposit here](https://uatpenn.apps.upenn.edu/uatPenn/jsp/fast.do?fastStart=directdep).

However, Penn can take over a month to activate direct deposit after you provide your bank account information.
If your direct deposit isnâ€™t active by time payments are scheduled, you will be paid via an ADP Aline Card.
Check [U@Penn My Pay](https://uatpenn.apps.upenn.edu/uatPenn/jsp/fast.do?fastStart=pay) to see whether you were paid to your bank account or ADP.

The ADP Aline Card is a sort of enhanced debit card.
For your first ADP payment, the physical card is mailed to your postal address on record.
You can call ADP Account Services at **877-237-4321** to inquire whether your card is in transit.

If you receive an Aline Card, you can activate it and create an account [online](https://www.visaprepaidprocessing.com/ADP/PayRoll/Home/Index).
From the website, you can then transfer the full debit card balance to a bank account.
You can also withdraw cash from an [automated teller](https://www.visaprepaidprocessing.com/ADP/PayRoll/Program/ATMLocator?m=1).

### Special considerations for Postdocs

Postdocs at Penn have unique tax considerations.
Specifically, some postdocs may not have Federal taxes withheld from their paycheck even though they are responsible for these taxes.
See the [Biomedical Postdoctoral Council Tax Issues Page](http://www.med.upenn.edu/bpc/TaxIssues.shtml) for more information.
