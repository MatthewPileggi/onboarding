Tips for Newcomers to Penn and Philadelphia
-------------------------------------------

**Penn payroll system:**
Penn offers `two options`_ for getting paid: direct deposit and the ADP
Aline Card. Most lab members use direct deposit to their US bank
account. You can `configure direct deposit here`_. However, Penn can
take over a month to activate direct deposit after you provide your bank
account information. If your direct deposit isnâ€™t active by time
payments are scheduled, you will be paid via an ADP Aline Card. Check
`U@Penn My Pay`_ to see whether you were paid to your bank account or
ADP. The ADP Aline Card is a sort of enhanced debit card. For your first
ADP payment, the physical card is mailed to your postal address on
record. You can call ADP Account Services at 877-237-4321 to inquire
whether your card is in transit. If you receive an Aline Card, you can
activate it and create an account `online`_. From the website, you can
then transfer the full debit card balance to a bank account. You can
also withdraw cash from an `automated teller`_.
