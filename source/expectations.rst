Expectations
------------

**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success
of your research project and career development. As a member of the lab, you
are expected to participate fully in the team. When disagreements about
methodological approaches arise, you recognize that these should be resolved
through a solid and reproducible analysis of available data. In general, lab
members are expected to be present from 9:30AM to 4:00PM on weekdays to
facilitate discussion within the group. If you aren’t sure — ask.

**Casey's role:** Casey’s goal is to facilitate your success as well as that of
your project. Within your project, Casey will serve as a sounding board for
ideas, will help you plan your project, and will help to devise experiments to
test your hypotheses. To facilitate your success, Casey will help you to plan
your training, to devise a career plan that can take you to where you want to
go, to advise you on your project-risk portfolio, and to provide guidance on
other elements of career and project development as needed.

**Code of Conduct:** All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to
agree with this code of conduct. We will enforce this code. We expect
cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack
thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including
lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. However, do note that we work on
biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are
appropriate. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any
harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
other concerns, please contact Casey Greene immediately. If Casey is the cause
of your concern, Dr. Deborah Hogan (Deborah.A.Hogan@dartmouth.edu) is a
good informal point of contact; she does not work for Casey and has agreed to
mediate. For official concerns, please see the University of Pennsylvania ombuds
office. The code of conduct section is licensed under a Creative Commons

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

**Authorship:** Our lab follows the `Perelman School of Medicine Authorship
Policy <https://www.med.upenn.edu/policy/user_documents/2_Announcement_MemoLJLRE_PerelmanSchoolofMedicineAuthorshipPolicy.pdf>`_.
These guidelines are derived from ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts
Submitted to Biomedical Journals.

**Ethics:** We expect lab members to be honest in scientific communications
both within and outside the lab. We expect that lab members will design
experiments in a manner that minimizes both bias and self deception. We
expect that lab members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code
and results openly with the scientific community. We expect that credit will be
given where credit is due, including in scientific writing. Plagiarism is not
tolerated. While a full enumeration of ethical considerations is outside of the
scope of this document, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns
that you have.
