Communication
-------------

General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Slack:** We use slack for rapid communication within the lab. If you'd send an
e-mail to someone within the lab, try a slack message instead. This helps to
keep communications in one place, and Casey commits to respond to slacks (not
necessarily immediately, but the same guarantee is not made for e-mail).

**Bonus.ly:** We recognize that people regularly go above and beyond lab
expectations. We wanted a way to recognize each other when this happens. We
now use bonus.ly. This allows lab members to send a quick virtual thank you
note and/or pat on the back. If someone’s paper gets accepted or someone helps
you out with a programming question, congratulate or thank them. Slack includes
/give syntax that you should explore (or /give someone a point for helping
you). When one member accumulates enough bonus.ly points, they take the lab out
to lunch (Casey pays).

**Social Media:** Lab members are encouraged to communicate through public
social media, and if you choose to do so then you are expected to follow our
code of conduct.

**Projects:** By the nature of our research, lab members will often have the
opportunity to participate projects managed via private or publicly accessible
source code repositires. In these cases, lab members are expected to: follow
the code of conduct; expect that private repositories will be world accessible;
and to communicate via the project-specific medium (e.g. if Rene reported an
issue on a project on bitbucket, it would not be appropriate for Casey to reply
"I'll drop by your desk and show you how to solve that.").

**IP/Openness:** This is handled in accordance with the instructions from our
research sponsors and university guidance. Lab members must follow the Penn
Participation Agreement and the agreements with our sponsors. These often allow,
encourage, or require openness. If you have concerns at any point, set up a
meeting with Casey to discuss these concerns.

Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Scrum:** The scrum is a 10 minute or less meeting that is held every day. It is
currently scheduled for 9:30 AM. The goal of the scrum is to communicate
recent progress and objectives. The scrum is held both in person and via our
appear.in channel. Those who work partial schedules (part-time employees,
undergraduate students) are only expected to scrum on days that they work. In
each scrum, every lab member provides a short summary of:

    1. What he/she accomplished yesterday.
    2. What he/she plans to accomplish today.
    3. Who, if anyone, is blocking him/her?
    4. Who, if anyone, is he/she blocking?

**Lab Meeting:** Lab meeting is held weekly at a location at Penn and also via our
appear.in channel. Scheduling is managed via a google spreadsheet. See the
#labmeeting slack channel's header for a link. Lab meeting consists of two
components described below.

    * Journal Club
    * Braintrust

**Journal Club:** We have a 15 minute journal club to start  each lab meeting. For
journal club, prepare a presentation of 4-5 papers. All except for one should
have been published since your last journal club presentation. The presentation
should be simple and shouldn’t take much time to prepare. During the
discussion, please share why you picked the paper, its implication for your
research, and any potential implications that touch on other research that is
ongoing in the lab.For each paper, the presentation should consist of:

    1. A title slide
    2. An overview slide (usually a flow-chart of some sort from the paper,
       could also be an initial result that sets context).
    3. The results figure that convinced you to pick this paper.

**Braintrust:** Present something that you wish to talk about to the group. This
could be a confounding result, an interesting result, an analysis that isn’t
working, etc. This is your chance to have the group focus on and help you solve
a challenge that you’re facing.

**Individual Meetings:** We schedule weekly individual meetings. Once you join the
lab, contact Casey to set up a time. These are set up for a term to accomodate
class schedules. We don’t reschedule these meetings by default if one of the
parties (Casey or you) are out of town, so if you do want to meet in a week but
travel conflicts, contact Casey to reschedule. The goal of the weekly meeting
is to:

1. Discuss challenges.
2. Plan strategy (project related, personal career, etc).
