Infrastructure Guide
-------------

**Compute Resources:** Lab members are provided with a desktop. For rotation
and undergraduate students, these machines may be shared. For full time
lab members, the operating system should be reinstalled when the member joins.
Large-scale computation and web hosting are performed via commercial cloud
providers. Please discuss your project's computing needs with Casey to best
optimize resource usage.

**Accounts:** We have accounts with a number of key services. When a lab member
joins, accounts should be created in:
* Slack
* Bonus.ly
* Dropbox

In addition, lab members should have accounts with bitbucket and github. These
accounts should get added to our:
* `bitbucket team account <https://bitbucket.org/greenelab/>`_ (Greenelab)
* `github team account <https://github.com/greenelab/>`_ (Greenelab)

**Purchasing:** There are two different purchasing procedures depending on
whether or not the vendor is an approved university vendor. For approved
vendors (check the `Penn Marketplace
<http://www.purchasing.upenn.edu/shopper/>`_), you need to fill out a
`pharmacology requisition form
<https://bitbucket.org/greenelab/onboarding/raw/tip/forms-and-docs/regular-vendor-purchase-form.xlsx>`_.
For other suppliers where a credit card purchase is required, you will need to
fill out a `p-card order form
<https://bitbucket.org/greenelab/onboarding/raw/tip/forms-and-docs/p-card-order-form.pdf>`_.
In either case, the completed form should be sent to
phorders\@mail.med.upenn.edu and Casey should be cc'd on the email.
