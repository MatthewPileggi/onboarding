Coding and Software
===================

Language: We write code for our analyses in Python. We have standardized on a
language because anyone in the lab needs to be able to come in and understand
analytical code. Code for plotting can be Python or R. Webserver interface code
will also use javascript.

Coding Standards: We follow pep8 for python. We advise that each person runs
a linter (if you're not sure -- ask!) as part of their development environment.
At some points 

Commenting: We expect docstrings for functions, comments at the top of scripts
to describe their function and usage, and other elements that make code more
readable.

Using Other Code: We release source code under a BSD license. As long as the
code that you're using doesn't conflict with this, we are happy.

Licensing: We expect code that we produce to be licensed under a 3-clause BSD
license. Unless a funding agency requires something different, we'll use this.
If you have questions or concerns about licensing, feel free to raise them in
Slack.

Data Management: How are data preserved, analyzed, etc.

IP/Openness: How is sharing managed? Is IP a concern?

Record Keeping: How do we record our actions?

Reproducibility: How do we ensure our analyses are reproducible?
